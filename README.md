📈 Sales Dashboard (Main Dashboard)

The Sales Dashboard is the core dashboard of the project.
It focuses on analyzing overall sales performance and contains multiple analytical pages.

🏠 Home Page – Sales Overview
The Home Page provides a high-level overview of sales performance. It displays key KPIs such as total sales, total profit, total orders, profit margin, and peak sales month. MTD and YTD cards help monitor short-term and long-term trends. This page allows users to quickly assess overall sales health.

📊 Sales Page
This page offers a detailed view of overall sales performance. It shows total sales, profit, total orders, and profit margin. Users can apply filters such as date, location, OEM, territory, salesperson, product type, and customer. Visuals highlight top salespersons, location-wise sales distribution, OEM group contribution, and sales trends across months, quarters, and years.

🏭 OEM Page
The OEM page analyzes sales performance by OEM partnerships. It helps identify which OEMs are contributing consistently to sales and profit. By tracking volumes and trends over time, this page supports identifying strategic OEM partners versus transactional ones.

👥 Customer Page
The Customer page evaluates customer contribution and behavior over time. It focuses not only on sales value but also on customer loyalty and repeat purchases. Metrics such as customer value and order frequency help in deciding retention strategies and shifting focus from one-time sales to long-term customer relationships.

📦 Product Type Page
This page highlights sales and profit by product type. It helps identify top-performing and underperforming product categories. The insights support decisions related to product focus, pricing strategies, bundling, and future product planning based on customer demand trends.

🌍 Territory Page
The Territory page provides insights into sales and profit performance by region. It helps identify strong and weak territories, market maturity, and growth potential. This page supports territory-wise sales planning, resource allocation, and regional expansion strategies.

🏷️ Stock Dashboard (Separate Dashboard)
The Stock Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of inventory status. It displays current inventory levels, stock value, and OEM-wise stock distribution. Low stock items are highlighted to support proactive replenishment planning. The dashboard also supports warehouse categorization and stock movement tracking. Interactive filters allow exploration based on product category, reorder status, and OEM.

📑 Sales Order Status Dashboard (Separate Dashboard)
This dashboard provides an overview of sales order health. It tracks key metrics such as total orders, pending quantities, order processing time, and fulfillment rates. The dashboard helps identify operational bottlenecks, especially in pending orders, with the goal of streamlining order processing and improving customer satisfaction.

💰 Customer Receivables Dashboard (Separate Dashboard)
The Customer Receivables Dashboard focuses on outstanding customer payments. It tracks overdue status, overdue amounts, and aging buckets such as 0–30, 31–60, and 61–90 days. This dashboard helps identify delayed payments, improve cash flow management, and streamline collection efforts by prioritizing overdue accounts.
